/**
 * This should be a top-down recursive-descent parser from the grammar G.
 * The output of the parser is the stack-based intermediate code S,
 * corresponding to the given program, written to standard output(stdout).
 * If the expression is not in the language (or if an ERROR token is returned by the Lexer)
 * then the parser should output the erorr message "Syntax error!"
 * (at the point when the error is recognized) and immediately quit.
 *
 * The parser should have at least two (private) member variables, one of type
 * Lexer, the other of type Token (for the current token). It should only have a
 * single public method, parse(), for initiating the parse - other methods are private.
