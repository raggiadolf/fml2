/**
 * Implement the (main) class, Interpreter. This class reads S, the stack-based
 * intermediate code, from standard input (stdin), interprets it and executes it "on-the-fly".
 * The result is written to standard output. The main program of the interpreter should correspond
 * to the general function of interpreter, i.e. the fetch-decode-execute cycle.
 *
 * If the Interpreter encounters an invalid operator, or if there are not sufficiently many
 * arguments for an operator on the stack, then it should write out the error message:
 * "Error for operator: nameOfOperator" (Where nameOfOperator is the operator in question)
 * and immediately quit.
 * Use a Stack class to process the intermediate code and use a Map class to store the values
 * of identifiers.
