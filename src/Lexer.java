 * Should contain a public method, nextToken(), which scans the standard input (stdin),
 * looking for patterns that match one of the tokens from Token.
 * Note that the lexemes corresponding to the tokens PLUS, MINUS, MULT, LPAREN, RPAREN,
 * ASSIGN, SEMICOL contain only a single letter.
 * The patterns for the lexemes for the other tokens are:
 *      INT   = [0-9]+    (non-empty, finite sequence of digits)
 *      ID    = [A-Za-z]+ (non-empty, finite sequence of upper- and lower-case letters)
 *      END   = end
 *      PRINT = print
 * The lexical analyzer returns a token with TokenCode = ERROR if some illegal lexeme is found.
